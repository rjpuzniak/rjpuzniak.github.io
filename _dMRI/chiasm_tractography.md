**Objective**: To measure the connectivity the optic chiasm in controls and people with albinism (PWA) \
**Data**: diffusion MRI (dMRI) images of 9 PWA and 8 controls \
**Methods**: analysis of dMRI data, machine learning (logistic regression) \
**Relevance**: This [scientific article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219304024) demonstrated that **dMRI measurements of optic chiasm can distinguish PWA from controls**, and can be potentially used for albinism diagnositcs.

### Overview

The human optic chiasm is a part of the brain where optic nerves partially cross. In **people with albinism (PWA)**, there is an abnormally high proportion of crossing fibers in the optic chiasm. This study used a technique called **diffusion MRI (dMRI)** to identify these abnormal crossings in the optic chiasm of PWA and controls.

We used several methods to analyze the diffusion MRI data and found that Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) model in combination with streamline post-processing was the most effective way to identify the crossings. The results were also validated using functional MRI in a subset of individuals with albinism.

The findings of this study provide evidence for a novel, alternative way of detecting abnormalities in the chiasm. Identifying these abnormalities can help clinicians develop better treatments for individuals with albinism and other related conditions.
