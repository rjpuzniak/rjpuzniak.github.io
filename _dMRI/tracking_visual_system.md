**Relevance**: This [review article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10309-020-00384-y) introduces readers to basics and best practices of dMRI analysis, as well as provides sources on how to apply to epilepsy surgery.

### Overview

Epilepsy surgery is a treatment for seizures that don't respond to medication, but it can be risky because it may harm important parts of the brain. In the case of the visual system, damaging the optic radiation during surgery can cause problems with vision after surgery. However, a technique called diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can help reduce this risk. This article explains how dMRI can be used to map the visual pathways in the brain, step by step. This includes collecting data, preparing it, identifying the localization of components of the visual system, and using dedicated methods to reconstruct the neural pathways. Understanding this process can help doctors plan the surgery better and minimize the risk of damaging important brain structures.
