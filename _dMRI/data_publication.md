**Objective**: To enable neuroscientic research by providing **high-quality imaging data of people with albinism** (PWA) and controls \
**Data**: **diffusion MRI** data of 9 PWA, 8 controls and 2 people with achiasma and **functional fMRI** data for subset of participants \
**Methods**: diffusion MRI, functional MRI, [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/about/), cloud services \
**Relevance**: This [data descriptor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01080-w) provides researchers and physicians with access to multi-modal, high-quality data of the participants with very rare congenital disorders of the visual system, accessible on cloud computing platform [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/pub/5dea42a96c0bd9c0508554a2).

### Overview

We provide a set of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from humans with albinism and achiasma that includes T1, diffusion, and functional T2*-weighted images. This collection of data can be used to develop and test methods for tractography, which is a method enabling reconstruction of neural pathways within the brain. The provided dataset can be also generally used to study how the visual system works in people with congenital abnormalities. The MRI data are provide along with tools and files to prepare and analyze the data, as well as pre-made binarized masks to help with the tractography.
